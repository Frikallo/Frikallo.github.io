description: An implementation of model & data-parallel autoregressive language models with Mesh Tensorflow for distributed TPUs.
---

[GPT-Neo](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neo) is an implementation of model & data-parallel autoregressive language models, utilizing [Mesh Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/mesh) for distributed computation on TPUs.

GPT-Neo is considered deprecated and is no longer maintained. We suggest that those looking for a TPU-centric codebase use Mesh Transformer JAX instead.
