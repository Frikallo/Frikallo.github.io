---

YAKbot is a collection of AI models based on image generation, analysis, and processing; all wrapped into one Discord Bot. YAKbot's out-of-the-box commands range from image generation with VQGAN+CLIP or guided diffusion to image analysis and captioning with personality.

A full list of YAKbots commands and uses can be found either in discord with the .help command or in the [YAKbot's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Frikallo/YAKbot).
